# Beat-drop : An analytic project on music streams.
# This project begins with a wide-view on the charts and playlists on several platforms,then zooms in with a special focus on Spotify.
# Tools used : Microsoft Excel and PowerBI

Right after cleaning the data,a new column for the release date was created then joined to the overall model as a new table.The first dashboard compares Apple Music,Deezer,Shazam and Spotify with respect to the number of tracks in their charts and playlists.It also illustrates the top 10 streamed tracks and outlines numerous aspects regarding the quality of music.The second dashboard,however,is particularly concerned with music streaming on Spotify.Therein,we get to explore the top 4 streams by Month and have a clear-cut description of the most streamed track.

Both dashboards have a number of filters in common,that is - the release date,the artist and the music tracks.Application of these filters gives us more information on the number of streams and music quality depending on acousticness,danceability,energy,instrumentalness,liveness & speechiness.

As illustrated in the first dashboard,Apple music records the highest number of tracks in their charts while Spotify records the highest number of tracks in their playlists.Here,we can also see the average beats per minute on each track and the number of artists involved.

From the second dashboard,songs released on Friday register the highest number of streams.Additionally,so does September document the highest number of average streams.Here,we get to note a steady increase in the total number of streams from 2018 to 2022.

In conclusion,most Spotify users are inclined to music exploration from the playlists in comparison to the charts.
